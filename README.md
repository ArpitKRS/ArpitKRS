Hii, I'm Arpit 👋

🎓I'm an Open Source Enthusiast and a Freshman pursuing my bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering.

✨ I'm very passionate about Docker, Kubernetes and DevOps, Machine learning, Deep Learning, and Web Development as well and I'm also trying to explore as much as I can, currently trying hands in Android Dev and Google cloud related events. I have some experience in sparkAr and Unity too.

❤️ I'm seeking opportunities to start contributing in open source projects for improving my skills.

⭐ I would love to start writing some articles to share as well.

😇 I spend most of my time learning DSA and making projects along with learning new stuffs.
