Hii, I'm Arpit 👋

🎓I'm an Open Source Enthusiast and a Freshman pursuing my bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering.

✨ I'm very passionate about Docker, Kubernetes and DevOps, Machine learning, Deep Learning, and Web Development as well and I'm also trying to explore as much as I can, currently trying hands in Tensorflow and Google cloud related events. I have some experience in sparkAr and Unity too.

❤️ I'm about to start contributing in open source projects and currently I'm looking for some good projects in which I can learn as well.

⭐ I would love to start writing some articles to share as well as gain knowledge about tech world.

😇 I spend most of my time learning DSA and making projects along with learning new stuffs.
